### Steps
Lay all the pieces on the table to create an overview of what you have:

Some of the pieces of wood may not entirely be cut through. Use a scalpel to finish the work of the laser cutter.

Some laser cutters leave quite a bit of smoke. You can try removing this with a brush or a cloth damped with some benzine, but in my case, this did not help much.

The next step is to apply varnish. I applied only a very thin layer. If you apply varnish on one side of each part one by one, the sides will be dry by the time you start on the other side. Be careful when applying varnish around holes and other shapes, as the varnish easily accumulates on edges and in corners.

Here you see some of the parts after I was finished.

Next, insert the magnets. Be sure to insert each of them with the correct orientation. A good way to do this, is to keep them stuck to each other while inserting them. Be mindful when inserting the magnets in the lid, because of course, South will stick to North, and this determines the orientation of the lid when you are finished. All parts are symmetrical, so you can put them in both ways, but if you like one side a bit more than the other because, e.g., the wood has some damage, the orientation does matter.

I stuck the lid to the other part to see if I succeeded in keeping all the orientations correctly.

After this, I glued the filter guides in the correct place.

Subsequently, I glued all the sides to each other. It is best to take a straight surface to which you press the bottom parts while glueing, such that when everything is glued together, the air purifier does not wobble. I used some leftover plywood for this which I held down with a filled water bottle.

While the glue is drying, apply the LEDs to the middle piece. Carefully cut the LED strip in four segments of three LEDs. Connect two connectors to three of the segments, and only one to the fourth. Cut three pieces of 6.5cm, and one piece of around 25cm of the LED cable. Then, carefully apply the LED segments on the piece that supports the filter. Put the filter already in place such that you do not accidentally stick the LEDs too close to the filter. Also ensure not to stick the LEDs over the edge of the wood. After you stuck the LEDs to the wood, insert the cable in the connectors of adjacent LED segments and firmly press the connector to close it and make good contact with the wire. Be sure that the orientation of the wire in each of the connectors is the same. The long wire segment goes to the first LED segment located next to the hole. This hole feeds the wire through the fan section to the electronics. The final result should be as in the picture below.
