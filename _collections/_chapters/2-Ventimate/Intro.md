## Indoor air quality
We spend much of our time indoors. Maintaining good air quality inside your home is crucial for overall health and well-being. Let's go through a few key indicators of a healthy indoor atmosphere:

1. **Particulate Matter (PM):**
   - PM refers to a tiny airborne particles that can be both solid or liquid. PM10 refers to particles smaller than 10 micrometers, whereas PM2.5 refers to particles smaller than 2.5 micrometers.
   - Sources can be outdoors, such as construction sites, unpaved roads, smokestacks, and (wild)fires. And indoors, such as the burning of candles, cooking, and doing the laundry.
   - PM can have serious health effects, especially fine particles (PM2.5) can penetrate deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream.

2. **Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs):**
   - VOCs are present in the air in gaseous form. The quantity of VOC is expressed in parts per million. This number works similar to percentages, but 1 ppm is a 10.000 times smaller quantity than 1%.
   - VOCs have all kinds of sources. Common materials that release VOCs include building materials, cosmetics, printers, and cleaning agents.
   - These compounds can have short- and long-term health impacts and are often higher indoors than outdoors.

3. **Indoor CO2 levels:**
   - Outdoor CO2 levels historically are around 400 ppm. However, indoor CO2 levels can increase as people gather and indoor spaces are not properly ventilated.
   - High concentrations of CO2 can lower the quality of your sleep and your concentration during the day. 
   - Proper ventilation is important to keep high CO2 concentrations at bay.
