        - Tip: Many cities have a [FabLab](https://www.fablabs.io/), and many of them are equipped with high-end laser cutters. You can go there without any account and personnel is present that can help you get started with laser cutting. Sometimes, these labs also have material you can purchase. However, if you want to be sure to get high quality housing material, it is better to buy some material up front.
    - 3D printing:
        - Wood filament is a great option to obtain a housing with very stylish looks.
